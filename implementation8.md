# IMPLEMENTATION 8 - Practical Integrations, SMS Quota, Daraja, Scanner Library, Simplified Login, and Parent UX Plan

> **For agentic workers:** Implement this plan task-by-task with focused tests first. Use the existing NestJS API, Next.js web app, PostgreSQL RLS, request context, audit logging, encryption helpers, and current Railway/Vercel deployment shape. Do not introduce new infrastructure unless the task explicitly needs it.

**Goal:** Add practical Kenyan school integrations and simpler user flows to the existing My Shule ERP without turning the product into an overengineered enterprise platform.

**Primary outcomes:**

- Platform owner centrally manages SMS providers, SMS pricing, school SMS wallets, and SMS usage.
- Schools manage their own M-PESA Daraja/paybill credentials because schools own their fee collection accounts.
- Schools log in with email and password only; the system resolves the workspace automatically.
- Parents can access a lightweight mobile portal with phone/email plus password or OTP.
- Library circulation supports USB/Bluetooth/handheld barcode or QR scanners as fast keyboard input.
- The system remains practical for a solo founder to operate while scaling toward 1000+ schools.

**Non-goals:**

- Do not rebuild the ERP.
- Do not introduce Kubernetes, CQRS, event sourcing, microservices, or hardware SDKs.
- Do not let schools see platform SMS provider credentials.
- Do not make the ERP hold school funds.
- Do not expose raw secrets, OTPs, credentials, or API keys in UI, logs, reports, or audit metadata.

CODEX MASTER PROMPT - PRACTICAL SCHOOL ERP INTEGRATIONS, SMS QUOTA, SIMPLIFIED LOGIN, PARENT PORTAL, AND LIBRARY SCANNER

You are a Senior Fullstack SaaS Engineer improving an existing multi-tenant School ERP system used by schools in Kenya.

Your task is to enhance the current system incrementally with practical, real-world improvements focused on usability, simplicity, speed, maintainability, tenant safety, and realistic school workflows.

Do not redesign the entire system.
Do not overengineer.
Do not introduce unnecessary enterprise infrastructure.
Use the existing stack and patterns.

Core rules:
- Platform owner centrally manages SMS providers, SMS credentials, SMS pricing, SMS quotas, and SMS monitoring.
- Schools do not manage SMS provider API credentials.
- Schools consume SMS credits from their own school SMS wallet.
- Schools can buy/request more SMS credits.
- Each school manages its own Daraja credentials, paybill/till, shortcode, passkey, environment, and payment notifications.
- The ERP acts as middleware, reconciliation engine, and automation layer. It never holds school funds.
- Login should only ask for email/username and password. Remove tenant code/workspace code/school code from normal login.
- The system resolves the user's tenant/workspace automatically after authentication.
- Parent portal access should support phone or email, password or OTP, with SMS invite onboarding.
- The library module must support QR/barcode scanners as keyboard input. Do not build IoT or hardware driver integrations.
- Keep all experiences mobile-first and friendly for non-technical school staff and parents.

Implementation targets:
1. Platform SMS settings for TextSMS Kenya, Africa's Talking, and Twilio.
2. School SMS wallet/quota system with balance checks, deduction, low-balance alerts, purchase records, and logs.
3. School SMS dashboard showing balance, monthly usage, delivery rate, and recent logs without exposing provider secrets.
4. SMS sending flow: check balance, enforce quota, deduct credit, send via platform provider, store log, update delivery.
5. School Daraja settings: paybill, shortcode, consumer key, encrypted secret, encrypted passkey, environment, active status, test connection.
6. Callback flow: parent pays school paybill, Safaricom callback arrives, system identifies school, validates transaction, records payment, allocates fees, generates receipt, sends SMS notification.
7. Onboarding flow: school information, admin account, optional Daraja setup, SMS plan setup, finish.
8. Library scanner flow: scan student ID, scan book, issue instantly; scan book, return instantly, calculate fines.
9. Simplified parent portal: fee balances, receipts, exam results, announcements, attendance visibility only when the module exists, and school communication.
10. Performance: optimize for 1000+ schools, fast mobile UX, indexed tenant-scoped queries, queue SMS/callback side effects, cache safe read models, and load-test before release.

Security:
- Encrypt provider API keys, Daraja consumer secrets, passkeys, and callback secrets.
- Mask credentials in UI after save.
- Never log raw secrets.
- Store audit events for credential changes, SMS wallet adjustments, purchases, and integration changes.
- Enforce RBAC: platform owner for platform SMS providers; school owner/finance admin for Daraja; librarian/admin for library circulation; parents only see their linked children.

Output:
- Backend schema changes
- API endpoint map
- Frontend page map
- Service architecture
- SMS quota and deduction logic
- Daraja callback flow
- Library scanner workflow
- Simplified login flow
- Parent portal flow
- RBAC and audit updates
- Performance plan
- Production readiness checklist

Build the fastest practical implementation that can launch safely and scale gradually.

# 1. Current System Fit

The current repo already has most of the foundations needed:

- NestJS API modules with controllers, services, schema services, repositories, request context, permissions, and tests.
- PostgreSQL schemas with tenant-scoped RLS patterns.
- Next.js App Router frontend with school, portal, platform, support, billing, library, and auth surfaces.
- Support notification SMS relay work from Implementation 7.
- Payments and tenant finance code, including M-PESA related services.
- Library module backend and web routes that can be extended for scanner-first workflows.
- Auth flow with tenant memberships and invite/password recovery infrastructure.

Implementation 8 should reuse these patterns. The fastest path is to add small vertical slices, not a parallel integration platform.

# 2. Architecture Decisions

## 2.1 SMS Ownership

Platform owns:

- provider credentials
- sender IDs
- default provider
- provider health checks
- SMS pricing
- wallet adjustment policies
- global SMS monitoring

School owns:

- SMS wallet balance
- SMS usage
- recipient lists
- message content
- consent and communication preferences

School cannot:

- see provider API keys
- switch SMS provider
- edit sender credentials

## 2.2 Daraja Ownership

School owns:

- paybill/till
- shortcode
- Daraja app credentials
- passkey
- environment
- callback URLs configured in Safaricom portal

Platform provides:

- encrypted credential storage
- per-school credential loading
- payment validation and reconciliation
- receipt/SMS automation
- operational monitoring

The ERP never touches settlement funds. Money goes from parent to school paybill/till.

## 2.3 Scanner Hardware

Treat scanners as keyboard input devices.

No hardware SDK.
No drivers.
No IoT bridge.

Browser fields receive scanner text and submit on Enter.

## 2.4 Simplified Login

Normal login asks only:

- Email or username
- Password

Tenant resolution happens after credential verification by looking up the user's active membership.

If a user belongs to exactly one school, redirect directly.
If a platform owner logs in, redirect to platform workspace.
If a legitimate user belongs to more than one school, show a simple post-login "Choose school" page only for that edge case, not a normal workspace-code login.

## 2.5 Performance Target

Practical target for launch:

- 1000+ onboarded schools.
- 50k to 250k total users over time.
- Read p95 under 250 ms for common dashboards on warm cache.
- Write p95 under 700 ms for normal school actions.
- Callback processing acknowledgement under 2 seconds.
- Queue side effects for SMS, receipts, email, and callback retries.
- Scale API horizontally when needed.

"Thousands of users per second" should be treated as a load-test target for read-heavy and queued paths, not a promise that SMS providers or Daraja callbacks can process unlimited live writes instantly.

# 6. Frontend Page Structure

## 6.1 Platform Owner

Add to superadmin/platform settings:

```text
Platform Settings
  SMS Providers
  SMS Usage
  School SMS Wallets
  Integration Health
```

Screens:

- Provider cards with masked credentials.
- Add/edit provider drawer.
- Test connection button.
- Default provider badge.
- Delivery status summary.
- School wallet table.
- Wallet adjustment modal with reason.

## 6.2 School Admin and Finance Admin

Add:

```text
School Settings
  Integrations
    M-PESA Daraja
  SMS
    Balance
    Logs
    Purchase SMS
```

Daraja UI:

- masked credential fields
- environment switch
- paybill/till fields
- save/test buttons
- connection status badge
- callback URL copy button

SMS UI:

- current balance
- monthly used
- monthly limit
- delivery rate
- recent logs
- buy/request more SMS button

Do not show platform provider credentials.

## 6.3 Onboarding

Steps:

1. School Information
2. Admin Account
3. Daraja Setup
4. SMS Plan Setup
5. Finish

Daraja can be skipped with status `partially_configured`.

## 6.4 Login Pages

Remove from normal school login:

- tenant code
- workspace code
- school selector

Keep:

- email/username
- password
- forgot password
- remember me
- show password toggle

## 6.5 Parent Portal

Mobile-first pages:

- login with phone/email
- OTP screen
- children switcher
- fee balance
- receipts
- exam results
- announcements
- message school

Avoid dense dashboards.

## 6.6 Library Scanner UI

Librarian pages:

- `Library Dashboard`
- `Scan Issue`
- `Scan Return`
- `Book Register`
- `Books`
- `Overdue`

Scanner UX:

- large focused input
- auto-submit on Enter
- success/error banner
- last scanned item panel
- keyboard-only flow
- mobile-friendly fallback typing

---

# 7. SMS Quota and Deduction Logic

Use a single transaction for wallet deduction and log creation.

Pseudo-flow:

```text
sendSms(tenant_id, recipient, message, type)
  begin transaction
    wallet = lock school_sms_wallets where tenant_id = current tenant for update
    creditCost = calculateSegments(message)
    if wallet.balance < creditCost and allow_negative_balance is false:
      create rejected sms_log
      throw "SMS balance exhausted"
    deduct wallet balance
    increment monthly_used
    create sms_wallet_transaction
    create sms_log status=queued
  commit

  enqueue dispatch job
  worker loads default active provider
  worker decrypts provider credential
  worker sends provider request
  worker updates sms_log status/provider_message_id
```

Low balance:

- if `sms_balance <= low_balance_threshold`, create notification.
- rate-limit low-balance alert per tenant.

SMS purchase:

- Phase 1: purchase request/manual admin credit adjustment.
- Phase 2: online payment for SMS credits.

This is practical for a startup and avoids premature billing complexity.

---

# 8. Daraja Integration Flow

## 8.1 Save Credentials

```text
School finance admin saves Daraja settings
  validate shape only
  encrypt consumer secret and passkey
  store masked metadata
  audit "daraja_credentials_updated"
```

Never return raw secret after save.

## 8.2 Test Connection

```text
School clicks Test Daraja Connection
  load tenant integration
  decrypt credentials backend only
  request OAuth token from Daraja
  optionally validate shortcode access
  store integration_log
  return pass/fail without secrets
```

## 8.3 Callback

```text
Safaricom callback hits /payments/mpesa/callback/:integrationId
  identify integration and tenant
  verify callback shape and shortcode
  validate duplicate transaction id
  record raw-safe payment event
  match invoice/student by account reference
  allocate fee payment
  generate receipt
  enqueue SMS receipt notification
  return success to Safaricom quickly
```

Do callback side effects through queue if they can be slow.

---

# 9. Library Scanner Architecture

## 9.1 Book Registration

Required fields:

- barcode or QR code
- accession number
- ISBN
- title
- category
- shelf location
- availability status

Generate code:

- default QR payload can be accession number or book id.
- prefer accession number for printed labels because librarians understand it.

## 9.2 Issue Flow

```text
focus student scan input
scan student ID/admission number
resolve student
focus book scan input
scan book barcode/QR/accession
resolve book
if available:
  create transaction
  set book issued
  show success
else:
  show clear error
```

## 9.3 Return Flow

```text
focus book scan input
scan book
find active issued transaction
calculate fine if due date passed
mark returned
set book available
show success/fine
```

## 9.4 Scanner Detection

Use:

- `autoFocus`
- `onKeyDown` submit on Enter
- short debounce for scanners that do not send Enter
- keep manual submit button for fallback

No special hardware support required.

---

# 10. Simplified Login and Tenant Resolution

## 10.1 Backend Logic

```text
POST /auth/login
  email + password
  find user by email
  verify password
  load active memberships
  if platform owner:
    create platform session
  else if one active school membership:
    create tenant session for that school
  else if multiple active memberships:
    create pre-auth session and show simple choose-school page
  else:
    reject login
```

## 10.2 Data Rules

- Normal school staff should have one active school membership.
- Parent accounts may have children in one tenant first.
- Platform support users use platform/internal auth path.
- Do not ask normal users for tenant codes.

## 10.3 Frontend Changes

Remove workspace/tenant fields from:

- `/school/login`
- `/teacher/login`
- `/accountant/login`
- `/parent/login`
- shared public school login component

Keep tenant selection only for rare multi-membership resolution after login.

---

# 11. Parent Portal Flow

## 11.1 Invitation

```text
School registers student guardian
  create or link parent user
  send SMS invite using school's SMS wallet
  parent opens invite link
  parent sets password or verifies OTP
  parent portal opens linked children
```

## 11.2 Parent Login

Support:

- email + password
- phone + OTP
- phone + password if password exists

## 11.3 Parent Features

Mobile-first:

- fee balances
- fee statements
- receipts
- exam results
- announcements
- school messages
- attendance only if current product reintroduces attendance safely later

Because attendance has been retired from the current system, do not expose attendance unless a future implementation re-adds it with real backend support and readiness gates.

# 13. Performance and Scale Plan

## 13.1 Database

Indexes required:

- `school_sms_wallets(tenant_id)`
- `sms_logs(tenant_id, created_at desc)`
- `sms_logs(tenant_id, status, created_at desc)`
- `sms_wallet_transactions(tenant_id, created_at desc)`
- `school_integrations(tenant_id, integration_type, is_active)`
- `school_integrations(shortcode)` for callback lookup
- `integration_logs(tenant_id, created_at desc)`
- `library_books(tenant_id, barcode)`
- `library_books(tenant_id, qr_code)`
- `library_books(tenant_id, accession_number)`
- `library_transactions(tenant_id, status, due_date)`
- `users(lower(email))`
- `users(phone_number_hash)`
- `tenant_memberships(user_id, status)`

Use `FOR UPDATE` only around wallet deduction and critical stock/circulation transitions.

## 13.2 API

- Keep auth/login path simple and indexed.
- Avoid loading full dashboards on login.
- Paginate SMS logs, integration logs, library books, and parent records.
- Use projection queries instead of `SELECT *`.
- Keep callback acknowledgements fast.

## 13.3 Queues

Use existing Redis/BullMQ only for:

- SMS dispatch
- SMS delivery status polling/webhooks
- M-PESA callback side effects
- receipt generation if heavy
- low-balance notifications

Do not put normal CRUD behind queues.

## 13.4 Frontend

- Mobile-first parent pages.
- Avoid heavy charts for parent portal.
- Use small tables with pagination.
- Keep scanner pages client-side and keyboard-fast.
- Cache safe read data per route where possible.

## 13.5 Load Targets

Phase 1 release gate:

- 1000 schools in fixture/load plan.
- 100k users fixture model.
- 500 read RPS synthetic target.
- 100 write RPS targeted tenant-safe load.
- callback processing p95 under 2 seconds for acknowledgement.
- SMS queue can absorb spikes without losing wallet consistency.

Phase 2:

- 2000+ read RPS with horizontal API replicas.
- DB pooler tuned.
- common dashboards cached.
- query-plan review must pass for protected tables.

- Test parent OTP with staff phones.
- Test SMS wallet deduction in dry-run mode.

## Stage 2 - Pilot Schools

- Enable platform SMS settings.
- Assign initial SMS credits manually.
- Configure one real school Daraja sandbox or production credentials.
- Test paybill callback and receipt generation.
- Print 20 library QR labels and test scanner workflow.

## Stage 3 - Production

- Enable SMS purchase request flow.
- Enable Daraja self-service settings for finance admins.
- Enable parent SMS invites.
- Enable scanner workflows for librarians.
- Run weekly query-plan and load reviews during onboarding growth.

# 17. Final Architecture Verdict

This plan keeps My Shule practical:

- SMS is centralized because the platform pays and controls provider cost.
- Daraja is tenant-owned because schools own their funds.
- Login is simplified because schools should not remember workspace codes.
- Library scanning uses keyboard input because real scanners already work that way.
- Parent portal is mobile-first because most parents will use Android phones and mobile data.
- Scaling uses indexes, queues for side effects, provider smoke checks, and horizontal API growth rather than premature infrastructure complexity.

The fastest safe implementation is to ship this in vertical slices:

1. simplified login
2. SMS wallet/provider settings
3. Daraja settings and callbacks
4. scanner library workflows
5. parent OTP/mobile portal
6. performance/readiness gates

Do not expose any slice in production navigation until its backend, RBAC, RLS, audit, frontend, and focused tests pass.
