# Production Monitoring Runbook

Production monitoring uses scheduled, read-safe probes to catch provider, workflow, query, scale, and release-regression failures before schools report them.

## Schedule

| Check | Cadence | Command | Secret scope |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Synthetic journey monitor | Every 15 minutes | `npm run monitor:synthetic` | API/Web URLs, tenant id, monitor token |
| Core API load probe | Hourly | `npm run load:core-api` | API URL, tenant id, monitor token |
| Provider smoke | Every 6 hours | `npm run smoke:providers` | SMS, email, malware scanner, object storage |
| Query-plan review | Nightly | `npm run perf:query-plan-review` | Production database URL |
| Maintainability scan | Nightly and manual | `npm run maintainability:scan` | None |
| Release readiness | Nightly and manual | `npm run release:readiness` | None |
| Implementation 90 load profile | Nightly and manual | `npm run implementation90:load-profile` | None for static gate; production-like load evidence belongs in the release artifact |
| Implementation 90 full release gate | Before production promotion | `npm run implementation90:full-release-gate` | Production-like DB URL for query-plan review plus integration-test dependencies |
| Backup restore verification | Weekly and manual | `npm run dr:backup-restore` | DR database URL only |
| Incident drill validation | Weekly and manual | `npm run ops:incident-drill -- --dry-run` | None |

All scheduled runs are defined in [.github/workflows/production-operability.yml](/C:/Users/user/Desktop/PROJECTS/Shule%20hub/.github/workflows/production-operability.yml).

GitHub only allows manual dispatch for workflows that already exist on the repository default branch. Before first dispatch, merge the branch that introduces `production-operability.yml`; until then, run the same commands locally or through Railway with production environment variables.

## Required GitHub Secrets

- `PROD_API_BASE_URL`
- `PROD_WEB_BASE_URL`
- `PROD_MONITOR_TENANT_ID`
- `PROD_MONITOR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `PROD_DATABASE_URL`
- `DR_DATABASE_URL`
- `SUPPORT_NOTIFICATION_EMAILS`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `EMAIL_FROM`
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER_SMOKE_URL`
- `UPLOAD_MALWARE_SCAN_API_URL`
- `UPLOAD_MALWARE_SCAN_HEALTH_URL`
- `UPLOAD_MALWARE_SCAN_API_TOKEN`
- `UPLOAD_OBJECT_STORAGE_PROVIDER`
- `UPLOAD_OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`
- `UPLOAD_OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `UPLOAD_OBJECT_STORAGE_REGION`
- `UPLOAD_OBJECT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `UPLOAD_OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

`PROD_MONITOR_ACCESS_TOKEN` must be generated through `npm run monitor:create-service-account`; do not use a human JWT.
Create the monitor token only after the first real school tenant exists. Do not create fake tenants solely to satisfy monitoring.

Use `EMAIL_PROVIDER_SMOKE_URL=https://api.resend.com/emails` for Resend. The live email check authenticates against the sending endpoint with an intentionally invalid empty payload so no email is sent; HTTP 400/422 from Resend is treated as an authenticated credential probe.

SMS secrets are required only after a real SMS provider is configured:

- `SUPPORT_PROVIDER_SMOKE_REQUIRE_SMS=true`
- `SUPPORT_PROVIDER_SMOKE_LIVE=true`
- `SUPPORT_NOTIFICATION_SMS_WEBHOOK_URL`
- `SUPPORT_NOTIFICATION_SMS_WEBHOOK_HEALTH_URL=https://<sms-relay-domain>/ready`
- `SUPPORT_NOTIFICATION_SMS_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`
- `SUPPORT_NOTIFICATION_SMS_RECIPIENTS`

While the SMS relay is intentionally deployed in dry-run mode, keep `SUPPORT_PROVIDER_SMOKE_REQUIRE_SMS=false` and `SUPPORT_PROVIDER_SMOKE_LIVE=false`. The relay `/health` endpoint is liveness only; live provider smoke must use `/ready` so dry-run cannot pass as production delivery.

## Creating a Monitor Token

Set the script variables in a secure shell, then run one of the target modes:

```bash
export MONITORING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TENANT_ID="real-tenant-id"
export MONITORING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="production synthetic monitor"
export MONITORING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET_TARGET="github"
npm run monitor:create-service-account
```

The script stores only a hash in PostgreSQL and writes the raw token directly into the target secret store before committing the account row. Normal output contains account metadata only.

`github` target requires an authenticated GitHub CLI (`gh`). If `gh` is unavailable or not authenticated, either add the GitHub Actions secret manually through the repository settings or use the Railway target for Railway-hosted checks:

```bash
export MONITORING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET_TARGET="railway"
export MONITORING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_RAILWAY_SERVICE="My Shule"
export MONITORING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT="production"
npm run monitor:create-service-account
```

## Manual Dispatch

Open the `Production Operability` workflow and run one check at a time:

- `synthetic`
- `core-load`
- `providers`
- `query-plan`
- `readiness`
- `implementation90`
- `all`
- `backup-restore`
- `incident-drill`

Use `all` before production promotion, then run `npm run implementation90:full-release-gate` locally or in the release environment to prove the full final command group. Use individual checks while triaging to avoid noisy unrelated failures.

## Alert Routing

Every production alert must route to a real owner before the workflow is considered operational.

| Alert type | Primary owner | Destination | Fallback owner | Acknowledgement SLA |
|---|---|---|---|---:|
| Synthetic journey failure | Support lead | GitHub Actions notification and support operations inbox | Platform owner | 15 minutes |
| Core API load breach | Engineering owner | GitHub Actions notification and engineering operations inbox | Platform owner | 15 minutes |
| Implementation 90 budget breach | Engineering owner | GitHub Actions notification and engineering operations inbox | Platform owner | 15 minutes |
| Provider smoke failure | Platform owner | GitHub Actions notification and support operations inbox | Support lead | 15 minutes |
| Query-plan regression | Engineering owner | GitHub Actions notification and engineering operations inbox | Platform owner | 1 business day |
| Backup restore failure | Engineering owner | GitHub Actions notification and platform owner inbox | Platform owner | 30 minutes |
| Security audit failure | Security owner | GitHub Actions notification and platform owner inbox | Engineering owner | 30 minutes |

Manual verification:

1. Dispatch the `Production Operability` workflow with `check=incident-drill`.
2. Confirm `production-incident-drill.json` is uploaded.
3. Confirm the owning inbox or GitHub notification destination receives the workflow result.
4. Record the owner, destination, fallback owner, acknowledgement time, and artifact link in the incident timeline when an alert is tested.

## Triage

- Synthetic failure: inspect the failing step id, confirm `GET /health/ready`, then confirm the affected web/API route manually.
- Core-load failure: compare p95/max latency with the route and query-plan review. Check database indexes before increasing capacity.
- Provider smoke failure: check whether the failure is email, SMS, malware scanner, or object storage. Do not disable required provider flags to hide a broken dependency.
- Query-plan failure: review the reported query and index recommendation. Treat tenant-wide scans on operational tables as release blockers.
- Maintainability gate failure: fix the listed source file before release. The gate blocks internal UUID copy in school workflows, public status fallback telemetry that looks unfinished, and generated browser artifacts in review scope.
- Implementation 90 gate failure: fix the failed scale, security, reliability, or runbook evidence before release. Do not raise public launch traffic until `npm run implementation90:load-profile`, `npm run perf:query-plan-review`, and `npm run implementation90:full-release-gate` are passing with production-like evidence attached.
- Release readiness failure: treat the missing artifact or gate failure as a code release issue, not an infrastructure incident.

## Maintainability Gate

Run `npm run maintainability:scan` before every production deployment. The gate blocks internal UUID copy in school workflows, public status fallback telemetry that looks unfinished, and generated browser artifacts in review scope.

## Rotation

Rotate monitor tokens at least every 90 days or immediately after a suspected leak:

1. Create a replacement token with `npm run monitor:create-service-account`.
2. Verify `Production Operability` succeeds with the new secret.
3. Revoke the old token through `MonitoringServiceAccountService.revokeToken` or a short admin maintenance script.
4. Confirm failed validation attempts are recorded in `monitoring_service_account_audit_logs`.

## Noise Control

If a check is noisy, reduce its blast radius without hiding the underlying failure:

- Lower `CORE_API_LOAD_ITERATIONS` temporarily during provider incidents.
- Use workflow dispatch to run only one check while debugging.
- Keep `UPLOAD_MALWARE_SCAN_REQUIRED=true` and `UPLOAD_OBJECT_STORAGE_ENABLED=true` for production gates.
- Turn on `SUPPORT_PROVIDER_SMOKE_REQUIRE_SMS=true` only when the SMS relay `/ready` endpoint confirms real provider readiness; never use dry-run SMS as a passing production gate.
- Document any temporary pause in the incident timeline with owner and expiry time.
